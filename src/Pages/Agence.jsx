            &nbsp; Our curiosity feeds our creativity. We remain humble and we
            say No to big egos, even yours. A brand is alive. She has values, a
            personality, a story. If we forget that, we can make good numbers in
            the short term, but we kill it in the long term. That's why we're
            committed to giving perspective, to build influential brands.
